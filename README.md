### MIDI Note Randomizer for REAPER

Features
* Drop down scale selection
* Drop down octave selection
* Drop down key selection
* Probability sliders for each note in the scale
 
*GUI by EUGEN27771*

This is completely unsupported, but here if you need it for any reason, otherwise I'd recommend MIDI Ex Machina.
